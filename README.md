this is my first video game. i made it when i was 15.
how to use:
when you run the code it will first ask you what you want you first charactor to be and then it'll ask what type you want and explain what each type means. 
if you dont put in one of the three listed types it'll restart that and ask you for that charactor's name and type again. once you choose a name and type it'll 
randomize the health and damage of the charactor based on the type you chose. and then it will tell you the name, type, health, and damage of the first 
charactor. then it will look like its just repeating but this time its just asking for the name and type of the second charactor. once the two charactors
have been made it will roll a 12 sided dice to determine which charactor attacts and repeats that until one wins.
